        <h2>Teams I Love</h2>
        <h3>No Objectivity</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Miami Heat</li>
          <li>Miami Dolphins</li>
          <li>Miami Marlins</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why The Heat Number 1?</h3>
        <p>
          As a young man i grew up idolizing Dwyane Wade. He was the greatest and coolest athlete I ever New. So it was only write for me to love his team more than any other.  I have never been lucky enough to live through a great Dolphin Quarterback so it really is no comparison but I hope one day to get an Oppurtunity to watch my Dolphins win the way the Heat have done in the past.  <strong>Maybe then I will love The Phins as much as I love The Heat</strong>
